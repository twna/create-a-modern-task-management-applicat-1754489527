Let's start with the first test case:\n\n\nOnce we navigate to the homepage, we will proceed with the subsequent steps for test case 1.

This process will involve navigating to a web page that allows us to send API requests (such as a custom testing page or a service like Postman), executing JavaScript to send the requests, and then verifying the responses.\n\nHere's a high-level plan for how we can perform this task:\n\n1. Navigate to a web page that allows us to send API requests.\n2. Fill in the necessary request details (HTTP method, endpoint URL, headers, body, etc.).\n3. Send the request.\n4. Capture the response.\n5. Validate the response status code and body to ensure it meets our expectations.\n\nBelow is a JSON request to the MCP server to perform this task using Puppeteer:\n\n\nPlease note that the above JSON is a high-level representation and the actual implementation would depend on the specific web page or service being used to send the API requests. The selectors and IDs used in the JSON would need to be replaced with the actual selectors of the elements on the web page.\n\nThe response from the API can be validated by checking the status code and the response body. If the status code is within the range of successful responses (e.g., 200-299) and the response body matches our expected result, we can consider the API endpoint to be functioning correctly.\n\nIf you would like to proceed with this plan, please provide the specific details of the API endpoints to be tested, and I can generate a more detailed script for browser automation."

It uses an `axios` call to fetch tasks from the backend based on the selected filter. The `useEffect` hook ensures that tasks are re-fetched whenever the filter changes.\n\n**Summary:**\nImplemented a task filtering feature on the frontend that allows users to filter tasks by status ('all', 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'). The feature uses a dropdown to select the filter and displays the filtered tasks.\n\n**Checklist:**\n- Add a dropdown select element to choose the task status filter.\n- Implement state management for tasks and the selected filter.\n- Use `axios` to fetch tasks from the backend based on the selected filter.\n- Display the filtered tasks in a list.\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- This implementation assumes that the backend-developer agent has already created the necessary API endpoints to fetch tasks by status.\n- The frontend should have `axios` installed for making HTTP requests.\n\nPlease note that the backend API endpoint `/api/tasks` should accept a query parameter `status` to filter tasks accordingly.
