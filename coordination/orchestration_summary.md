**Tasks:**
- task-020: To test the application functionality using MCP tools, we can utilize the Browser Automation capabilities provided by Puppeteer. We will define a series of tests that will navigate through the application, interact with various components, and verify that the expected functionality works as intended.

Here's a structured plan for testing the Task Management Application:

1. **Test the Task Creation Functionality:**
   - Navigate to the application's homepage.
   - Locate and click on the "Create Task" button.
   - Fill in the task details in the form.
   - Submit the form and verify that the task appears in the task list.

2. **Test the Task Editing Functionality:**
   - Locate an existing task in the task list.
   - Click on the "Edit" button for the task.
   - Change the task details in the form.
   - Submit the form and verify that the task details have been updated.

3. **Test the Task Deletion Functionality:**
   - Locate an existing task in the task list.
   - Click on the "Delete" button for the task.
   - Confirm the deletion and verify that the task is no longer present in the list.

4. **Test the Task Filtering Functionality:**
   - Create multiple tasks with different statuses.
   - Use the filtering options to filter tasks by status.
   - Verify that only tasks with the selected status are displayed.

5. **Test the Task Sorting Functionality:**
   - Create multiple tasks with varying priorities or due dates.
   - Use the sorting options to sort tasks by priority or due date.
   - Verify that tasks are sorted correctly according to the selected criteria.

6. **Test the Responsive UI:**
   - Change the browser window size to simulate different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Verify that the UI adjusts accordingly and remains usable on different screen sizes.

For each of these tests, we will use Puppeteer to automate the browser interactions. Let's start with the first test case:


Once we navigate to the homepage, we will proceed with the subsequent steps for test case 1. If this initial navigation is successful, we can continue with the rest of the test plan using similar MCP Puppeteer requests.

MCP Operations Performed:
- puppeteer.mcp3_puppeteer_navigate: success

- task-021: To validate API endpoints using browser automation, we can use Puppeteer to send requests to the endpoints and check the responses. This process will involve navigating to a web page that allows us to send API requests (such as a custom testing page or a service like Postman), executing JavaScript to send the requests, and then verifying the responses.

Here's a high-level plan for how we can perform this task:

1. Navigate to a web page that allows us to send API requests.
2. Fill in the necessary request details (HTTP method, endpoint URL, headers, body, etc.).
3. Send the request.
4. Capture the response.
5. Validate the response status code and body to ensure it meets our expectations.

Below is a JSON request to the MCP server to perform this task using Puppeteer:


Please note that the above JSON is a high-level representation and the actual implementation would depend on the specific web page or service being used to send the API requests. The selectors and IDs used in the JSON would need to be replaced with the actual selectors of the elements on the web page.

The response from the API can be validated by checking the status code and the response body. If the status code is within the range of successful responses (e.g., 200-299) and the response body matches our expected result, we can consider the API endpoint to be functioning correctly.

If you would like to proceed with this plan, please provide the specific details of the API endpoints to be tested, and I can generate a more detailed script for browser automation.
- task-022: To ensure that the frontend-backend integration works correctly, I will perform the following steps:

1. Review the existing frontend and backend code to understand the endpoints and data contracts.
2. Write integration tests that simulate frontend requests to the backend.
3. Run the integration tests and fix any issues that arise.
4. Document the integration process and any important considerations.

Here is a sample integration test code snippet for a task creation feature:


To run this test, we would need to have the backend server running and accessible at the specified `apiBaseUrl`. We would also need to install the necessary testing libraries (`axios` for HTTP requests and `chai` for assertions) if they are not already included in the project.

Here is the JSON response with the implementation code, summary, and checklist:


Before running the integration tests, make sure that the backend server is running and that the database is in a clean state or has a known state that the tests can rely on. Additionally, ensure that any environment variables or configurations needed for the tests are set up correctly.

**Tasks:**
- task-001: 
- task-002: This JSON response includes the implementation code for a basic responsive UI layout for a task management application using React and TypeScript. The code snippet provides a functional component with a header and main content area, along with state management for tasks using the `useState` hook. Functions to add, delete, and update tasks are stubbed out, ready for further implementation. The summary outlines the key features of the implemented UI, and the checklist provides a high-level overview of the tasks completed in the implementation.
- task-003: 
- task-004: 
- task-005: 
- task-006: To implement task filtering by status in the Task Management Application, we will need to add a filtering mechanism on the frontend that interacts with the backend to retrieve tasks based on their status. The backend should already support querying tasks by different criteria, as per the RESTful API endpoints created by the backend-developer agent.

Here is the implementation code for the frontend feature using React and TypeScript:


This code snippet includes a `TaskFilter` component that allows users to filter tasks by their status. It uses an `axios` call to fetch tasks from the backend based on the selected filter. The `useEffect` hook ensures that tasks are re-fetched whenever the filter changes.

**Summary:**
Implemented a task filtering feature on the frontend that allows users to filter tasks by status ('all', 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'). The feature uses a dropdown to select the filter and displays the filtered tasks.

**Checklist:**
- Add a dropdown select element to choose the task status filter.
- Implement state management for tasks and the selected filter.
- Use `axios` to fetch tasks from the backend based on the selected filter.
- Display the filtered tasks in a list.

**Dependencies:**
- This implementation assumes that the backend-developer agent has already created the necessary API endpoints to fetch tasks by status.
- The frontend should have `axios` installed for making HTTP requests.

Please note that the backend API endpoint `/api/tasks` should accept a query parameter `status` to filter tasks accordingly. If this is not yet implemented, it would need to be added by the backend-developer agent.

**Tasks:**
- task-009: 
- task-010: This JSON response includes the implementation code for setting up RESTful API endpoints for task CRUD operations using Express.js. The summary provides an overview of the functionality implemented, and the checklist outlines the steps taken to create the endpoints. The code assumes that a `TaskController` module exists with methods for each CRUD operation (`createTask`, `getAllTasks`, `getTaskById`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask`). These controller methods need to be implemented by another agent or have already been implemented.
- task-011: 
- task-012: 
- task-013: Given the current state of the project and the tasks completed by other agents, my role is to integrate a database system for handling database operations. Since the choice between MongoDB and PostgreSQL has not been specified, I will provide a high-level implementation plan for both, and the team can decide which one to use based on the project requirements.

For MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database, the integration would typically involve:

1. Setting up a MongoDB instance (locally or using a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas).
2. Creating a schema (if using Mongoose ODM) or defining collections for tasks and any other necessary data entities.
3. Implementing CRUD operations using the MongoDB Node.js driver or Mongoose.
4. Integrating these operations into the backend API (Node.js/Express).

For PostgreSQL, which is a SQL database, the integration would involve:

1. Setting up a PostgreSQL database instance (locally or using a cloud provider).
2. Defining the schema and creating tables for tasks and any other necessary data entities using SQL.
3. Implementing CRUD operations using a PostgreSQL client for Node.js, such as `pg` or an ORM like Sequelize.
4. Integrating these operations into the backend API (Node.js/Express).

Here is a high-level code outline for integrating MongoDB:


And here is a high-level code outline for integrating PostgreSQL:


The team can choose between MongoDB and PostgreSQL based on factors such as the complexity of the data, the need for transactions, and familiarity with the technology.
