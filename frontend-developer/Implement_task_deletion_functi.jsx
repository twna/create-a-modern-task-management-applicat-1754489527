    "summary": "Implemented a function `handleDeleteTask` that sends an HTTP DELETE request to the backend to delete a task by its ID. Upon successful deletion, the task is removed from the application state using a `removeTaskFromState` function. This function assumes the use of a state management system and dispatches an action to update the UI accordingly.",

        "Create handleDeleteTask function to send DELETE request",

        "Update state to reflect task deletion",
