To implement task filtering by status in the Task Management Application, we will need to add a filtering mechanism on the frontend that interacts with the backend to retrieve tasks based on their status. The backend should already support querying tasks by different criteria, as per the RESTful API endpoints created by the backend-developer agent.

Here is the implementation code for the frontend feature using React and TypeScript:


This code snippet includes a `TaskFilter` component that allows users to filter tasks by their status. It uses an `axios` call to fetch tasks from the backend based on the selected filter. The `useEffect` hook ensures that tasks are re-fetched whenever the filter changes.

**Summary:**
Implemented a task filtering feature on the frontend that allows users to filter tasks by status ('all', 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'). The feature uses a dropdown to select the filter and displays the filtered tasks.

**Checklist:**
- Add a dropdown select element to choose the task status filter.
- Implement state management for tasks and the selected filter.
- Use `axios` to fetch tasks from the backend based on the selected filter.
- Display the filtered tasks in a list.

**Dependencies:**
- This implementation assumes that the backend-developer agent has already created the necessary API endpoints to fetch tasks by status.
- The frontend should have `axios` installed for making HTTP requests.

Please note that the backend API endpoint `/api/tasks` should accept a query parameter `status` to filter tasks accordingly. If this is not yet implemented, it would need to be added by the backend-developer agent.
