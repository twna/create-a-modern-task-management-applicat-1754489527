To ensure that the frontend-backend integration works correctly, I will perform the following steps:

1. Review the existing frontend and backend code to understand the endpoints and data contracts.
2. Write integration tests that simulate frontend requests to the backend.
3. Run the integration tests and fix any issues that arise.
4. Document the integration process and any important considerations.

Here is a sample integration test code snippet for a task creation feature:


To run this test, we would need to have the backend server running and accessible at the specified `apiBaseUrl`. We would also need to install the necessary testing libraries (`axios` for HTTP requests and `chai` for assertions) if they are not already included in the project.

Here is the JSON response with the implementation code, summary, and checklist:


Before running the integration tests, make sure that the backend server is running and that the database is in a clean state or has a known state that the tests can rely on. Additionally, ensure that any environment variables or configurations needed for the tests are set up correctly.
