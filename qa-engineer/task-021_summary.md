To validate API endpoints using browser automation, we can use Puppeteer to send requests to the endpoints and check the responses. This process will involve navigating to a web page that allows us to send API requests (such as a custom testing page or a service like Postman), executing JavaScript to send the requests, and then verifying the responses.

Here's a high-level plan for how we can perform this task:

1. Navigate to a web page that allows us to send API requests.
2. Fill in the necessary request details (HTTP method, endpoint URL, headers, body, etc.).
3. Send the request.
4. Capture the response.
5. Validate the response status code and body to ensure it meets our expectations.

Below is a JSON request to the MCP server to perform this task using Puppeteer:


Please note that the above JSON is a high-level representation and the actual implementation would depend on the specific web page or service being used to send the API requests. The selectors and IDs used in the JSON would need to be replaced with the actual selectors of the elements on the web page.

The response from the API can be validated by checking the status code and the response body. If the status code is within the range of successful responses (e.g., 200-299) and the response body matches our expected result, we can consider the API endpoint to be functioning correctly.

If you would like to proceed with this plan, please provide the specific details of the API endpoints to be tested, and I can generate a more detailed script for browser automation.
