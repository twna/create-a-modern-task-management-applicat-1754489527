To test the application functionality using MCP tools, we can utilize the Browser Automation capabilities provided by Puppeteer. We will define a series of tests that will navigate through the application, interact with various components, and verify that the expected functionality works as intended.

Here's a structured plan for testing the Task Management Application:

1. **Test the Task Creation Functionality:**
   - Navigate to the application's homepage.
   - Locate and click on the "Create Task" button.
   - Fill in the task details in the form.
   - Submit the form and verify that the task appears in the task list.

2. **Test the Task Editing Functionality:**
   - Locate an existing task in the task list.
   - Click on the "Edit" button for the task.
   - Change the task details in the form.
   - Submit the form and verify that the task details have been updated.

3. **Test the Task Deletion Functionality:**
   - Locate an existing task in the task list.
   - Click on the "Delete" button for the task.
   - Confirm the deletion and verify that the task is no longer present in the list.

4. **Test the Task Filtering Functionality:**
   - Create multiple tasks with different statuses.
   - Use the filtering options to filter tasks by status.
   - Verify that only tasks with the selected status are displayed.

5. **Test the Task Sorting Functionality:**
   - Create multiple tasks with varying priorities or due dates.
   - Use the sorting options to sort tasks by priority or due date.
   - Verify that tasks are sorted correctly according to the selected criteria.

6. **Test the Responsive UI:**
   - Change the browser window size to simulate different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Verify that the UI adjusts accordingly and remains usable on different screen sizes.

For each of these tests, we will use Puppeteer to automate the browser interactions. Let's start with the first test case:


Once we navigate to the homepage, we will proceed with the subsequent steps for test case 1. If this initial navigation is successful, we can continue with the rest of the test plan using similar MCP Puppeteer requests.
