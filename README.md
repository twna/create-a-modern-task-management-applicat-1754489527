# Create a modern Task Management Application with:

    FRONTEND (React/TypeScript):
    - Clean, responsive UI with task creation, editing, and deletion
    - Task filtering by status (pending, in-progress, completed)
    - Real-time updates and smooth animations
    - Modern design with Tailwind CSS or similar
    - Form validation and error handling

    BACKEND (Node.js/Express):
    - RESTful API with proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    - Task CRUD operations with data validation
    - User authentication with JWT tokens
    - Database integration (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
    - Error handling and logging middleware
    - API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

    INTEGRATION:
    - Frontend should consume backend API endpoints
    - Proper error handling between frontend and backend
    - CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
    - Environment configuration for different deployment stages

    TESTING & QUALITY:
    - Use MCP tools to test the application functionality
    - Validate API endpoints with browser automation
    - Ensure frontend-backend integration works correctly
    - Generate optimization recommendations

    The agents should collaborate to ensure seamless integration between frontend and backend components.
