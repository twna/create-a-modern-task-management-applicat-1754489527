This JSON response includes the implementation code for setting up RESTful API endpoints for task CRUD operations using Express.js. The summary provides an overview of the functionality implemented, and the checklist outlines the steps taken to create the endpoints. The code assumes that a `TaskController` module exists with methods for each CRUD operation (`createTask`, `getAllTasks`, `getTaskById`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask`). These controller methods need to be implemented by another agent or have already been implemented.
