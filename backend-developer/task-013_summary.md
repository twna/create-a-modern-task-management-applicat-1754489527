Given the current state of the project and the tasks completed by other agents, my role is to integrate a database system for handling database operations. Since the choice between MongoDB and PostgreSQL has not been specified, I will provide a high-level implementation plan for both, and the team can decide which one to use based on the project requirements.

For MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database, the integration would typically involve:

1. Setting up a MongoDB instance (locally or using a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas).
2. Creating a schema (if using Mongoose ODM) or defining collections for tasks and any other necessary data entities.
3. Implementing CRUD operations using the MongoDB Node.js driver or Mongoose.
4. Integrating these operations into the backend API (Node.js/Express).

For PostgreSQL, which is a SQL database, the integration would involve:

1. Setting up a PostgreSQL database instance (locally or using a cloud provider).
2. Defining the schema and creating tables for tasks and any other necessary data entities using SQL.
3. Implementing CRUD operations using a PostgreSQL client for Node.js, such as `pg` or an ORM like Sequelize.
4. Integrating these operations into the backend API (Node.js/Express).

Here is a high-level code outline for integrating MongoDB:

The team can choose between MongoDB and PostgreSQL based on factors such as the complexity of the data, the need for transactions, and familiarity with the technology.
